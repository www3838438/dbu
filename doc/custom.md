### Customize/Build your own

**Building with the default configuration**

 * Install debian.
 * You must build from the same distribution as the target distribution (build *stable* systems on a build machine running Debian *stable*, *testing* systems on a machine running Debian *testing*...)
 * [`live-build`](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-live/) is used to build the live system/installer/ISO image.
 * Run `apt install make git`
 * Run `git clone https://github.com/nodiscc/dbu`
 * To run the build process with the default configuration, run `make all` from the root of the git repository.

The full live-build documentation can be found at `/usr/share/doc/live-manual/pdf/live-manual.portrait.en.a4.pdf.gz`

#### Makefile

The following `make` targets are available:

```

make all: run all build steps
make buildenv: install tools required for building the system
make clean: clean files downloaded during the build process
make update: download third party files/software
    make ffaddons: download prebuilt firefox addons
    make tbaddons: download prebuilt thunderbird addons
    make packageschroot: download third-party .deb packages
    make binaries: download prebuilt binaries for non-packaged software
    make themes: download extra gtk/wm themes
    make dotfiles: download extra configuration files
make xpi: rename firefox addons to make them auto-installable
make documentation: generate packages documentation (package lists to Markdown)
make lbbuild: run the live system build process

```

##### config/includes.chroot/

Files and directories placed here will be copied to the live system during build.
This is useful if you need to include modified configuration or data files (`etc/, opt/, usr/, ...`).

Scripts and data that do not belong to an existing Debian package should preferably be
distributed as a custom package. Debian packages can also handle custom configuration
files (see `dpkg-divert`).

##### config/package-lists/

 * `*.chroot`: lists of packages to install on the resulting image/system (live or installed)
 * `*.binary`: lists of additional packages to add to the ISO image `pool/` directory (to use as an offline repository/mirror) (not required for the live system to work)


Lines commented out with `#` will be ignored, except a few keywords (`#if...`)
Some keywords in comment fields can be used to generate end-user package documentation pages (see below).

##### config/packages.chroot

Place any custom .deb package here to install it on the live system. 
This is useful if a package 1. is not available in Debian (see requests for
packaging  at http://wnpp.debian.net/) and 2. you don't want to add a third-party
repository to your APT sources list (security/stability reasons).

Keep in mind that packages placed here will _not_ receive upgrades through APT,
unless someone packages it and uploads it under the same name to Debian archives.

Currently all custom packages are downloaded from the Makefile.
Putting binary .deb packages under git version control should be avoided.
 
### Documentation

#### Packages documentation
 
live-build ignores lines starting with `#` in package lists. 
Custom comment fields in package lists are used to control end-user package
documentation generation (`scripts/doc-generator.sh`). 

 * `#Name`: Name for the package list (eg. Libreoffice office suite)
 * `#Screenshot`: package name to link to on screenshots.debian.net
 * `#Cat`: Category for the package list (eg Office)
 * `#Desc`: Package name to use for the description. If this is omitted, the description for first package in the list is used.
 * `#Alt`: name of an alternative package, or other package related to this list
 * `#Res`: URL to a resource/help link to add on the package doc page (using the target webpage title)
 * `#NoDescription`: putting this line in any package list will remove the long/short description from the resulting markdown file
 * `#ChrootPkg`: When this points to a package, package information will be fetched from the corresponding .deb in config/packages.chroot/ instead of the APT database

`doc/packages/*, doc/packages.md` should not be edited manually (Run `make doc`
to update the markdown documentation from package lists.)

#### Adding more packages

Simply copy one of the example/premade package lists in `config/package-lists/disabled/`
to `config/package-lists/`, or write your own list and place it there.

### Changing the locale/language

TODO more default languages Currently only 2 locales (english and french) are
pre-generated, other languages have to be manually added to the build
configuration, and the ISO rebuilt.
